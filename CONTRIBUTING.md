## ISSUES
When you create an issue, make sure it :
- Says where the issue is, or come from
- Be clear about how to reproduce the issue (with code if possible)

### Furthermore please follow this convention for naming your issues:
```
<type>: your issue message
```
**`<type>`** can be one of the following :
- **cicd**: Changes to the CI/CD
- **docs**: Changes to the documentation
- **feat**: Creation of a new feature
- **fix**: Fix a bug
- **perf**: Changes that only improve performance
- **refactor**: A code change that do not add features or fix a bug
- **style**: Changes that does not affect the code (white-space, formatting, etc...)
- **test**: Creating a test

---
## COMMITS
Your commit messages must follow [Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
with the same **`<type>`** than in the issues naming convention above

if your commit solves an issue, you have to reference it with #ISSUE_NB

---
## BRANCHES

There is 3 types of branches:
 - `from-issue`
   - The branch name is created from the issue name
   - These branches are created from `master`
   - It's where we code
   - Once the issue complete they are merged to `master` after a successfull pull request
 - `master`
   - It's were are aggregated the new features
   - It's the only branch from which we can create a pull request to `production`
 - `production`
   - This branch should always be working and ready to use
   - It only accepts pull request from `master`

Your branch name should always refer to the issue it aims to fix.
Always create your branch from the master branch.
You work on your branch.
The CICD needs to be succesful before creating a pull request
Your pull request has to be reviewed and approved before merging to master


---
## PULL REQUEST
Your pull request should explains clearly what it does.

It should also briefly explain what it changes in the code.

The name of the pull request must follow the same rule as the commit convention (because merge will be turned into commit in master)
