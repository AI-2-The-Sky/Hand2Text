## pip

Install pip first

```
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
python3.8 get-pip.py
```

## Miniconda

Use miniconda for your python environments (it's usually unnecessary to install full anaconda environment, miniconda should be enough). It makes it easier to install some dependencies, like cudatoolkit for GPU support. It also allows you to acccess your environments globally.

Example installation:

```sh
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

For more explanation on this tool you should read this page <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/>

## direnv

With direnv you will not have to think about your virtualenv anymore. It will also be easy to manage secrets as environment variables.

See this link: <https://direnv.net/docs/installation.html>

It should be something like `curl -sfL https://direnv.net/install.sh | bash` depending on your OS.

For more explanation on this tool you should read this page: <https://direnv.net/>.

## AWS CLI

The AWS Command Line Interface will be necessary to push your data to the remote s3 storage.

Here are the steps you should follow for this: <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html>

# Initialize your repository

Now all these steps are specifics to this project, and this project only !

You should first `git clone` this project, and then `cd` to it's top directory for running all the following commands.

## Create a conda environment

Create new conda environment:

```sh
conda create -n myenv python=3.8
conda activate myenv
```

## Launch the script to initialize your project

If it's not with execute rights, you should add them

```sh
chmod +x .42AI/init.sh
```

Then you can run the script

```sh
.42AI/init.sh
```

## Verify you can launch the project

with this command

```sh
python train.py logger=mlflow
```
